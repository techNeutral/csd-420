/*
Create a class titled [your first="" name="" here=""] ThreeThreads.
In this class, you are to use three threads to output three types of characters to a text area for display.
In the first thread, you are to output random letter characters such as a, b, c, d â€¦
In the second thread, you are to output random number digits such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
In the third thread, you are to output random characters such as !, @, #, $, %, &, *
Display a minimum of 10,000 for each of the three sets.
Write test code that ensures all methods function correctly.

//the purpose of this assignment is to utilize multiple threads, and illustrate that the processing is occurring at the
//same time rather than have one loup finish before the other loops complete.
